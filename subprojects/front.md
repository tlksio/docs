# tlks.io : Front-End applications & public APIs

1. [Desktop Web Application](#web-application)
2. [Public API](#public-api)

This is the subproject that maintains all the front-end applications of
tlks.io.

## Desktop web application

Currently, we only develop one front-end application which is used for
all kind of devices like desktops but also for tablets and phones.

This application, is a web application based on
[express](http://expressjs.org) *node.js* microframework and managed by
[supervisor](http://supervisor.org) on production.

## Public API

tlks.io still doesn't provides a public API, initial work on APIs is planned
for the future *0.4.0* release.
