# tlks.io : scheduler

tlks.io schedule server.

## Introduction

tlks.io sometimes needs to execute certain tasks periodically, this tasks also
are not generated by an event inside the platform, instead of that they are
scheduled and repeated every a certain amount of time.

For example if we want to promote our content on social networks we may want:

*Publish a new status on @tlksio twitter account with one random talk from the
database every 6 hours*

tlks.io uses a scheduler server to execute this kind of process and monitor
them.
