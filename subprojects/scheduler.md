# tlks.io : scheduler

tlks.io schedule server.

**This subproject may be replaced in the future by
another one called [eventer](eventer.md)**

tlks.io sometimes needs to execute certain tasks
periodically, this tasks also are not generated by an
event inside the platform, instead of that they are
scheduled and repeated every a certain amount of time.

For example if we want to promote our content on
social networks we may want:

*Publish a new status on @tlksio twitter account with
one random talk from the database every 6 hours*

tlks.io uses a scheduler server to execute this kind
of process and monitor them.
