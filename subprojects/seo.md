3. [Rules for adding tags]
  As our content it's try to be user generated, we can't apply rules, but for our team, we'll try to follow this ones:
  1. If possible, try to use more than one word for each tag.
  2. Not use more than three tags for talk. Only if it could create a good new concept.
  3. Do not use similar tags. If we choose one, don't change the order or the words, plurals, etc. We have to mantain the first tag.
  4. Try to use the same tag in at least five talks. With this, we'll generate better content for the user (giving the opportunity to learn more) and to the search engines.
  5. Re-edit the title and the description of a talk, not just copy and paste the content of our sources. Try to explain in a simple way the content of the talk.
