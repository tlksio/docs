This is the documentation for *tlks.io*, a curated and community driven list
of technical talks.

## Introduction

tlks.io is not a single piece of software. It is more a platform based on a
microservices paradigm and designed to minimize the complexity of the system
and maximize the decoupling between its components.

Please, make sure you read our [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) documents
to see how these different pieces of software, called *microservices*, work
together to keep the system up & running, and their
[configuration & deployment](developers/deploy.md) before you start building or hacking
in one component by yourself.
